## Access the Project
- Github repository available [here](https://github.com/antellitocci/horiseon)
- Live web page (via Github Pages) available at [antellitocci.github.io/horiseon/](https://antellitocci.github.io/horiseon/)

## Javascript

The *Return to Top* button was created using two Javascript functions.
> The Javascript functions were borrowed from [w3schools,](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp) and the up arrow is used from my Pro package at [FontAwesome.](https://fontawesome.com/icons/arrow-circle-up?style=regular)
